# EcoRent Hub

Many university students residing in dormitories or hostels face challenges in acquiring and utilizing essential electrical appliances due to restrictions, limited space, and concerns about excessive electricity usage. The absence of a convenient and sustainable solution hinders students from accessing necessary appliances for a comfortable living environment within the bounds of university rules. This project aims to address these challenges by developing a rechargeable appliance rental platform, facilitating easy access to essential electrical items while adhering to university regulations and promoting eco-friendly practices among students.
